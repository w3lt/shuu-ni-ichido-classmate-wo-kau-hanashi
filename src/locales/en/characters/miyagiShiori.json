  "description": "The type of high school girl who doesn't talk about herself much and only interacts with her few friends. She isn't at the bottom of the school caste system, but she is at the bottom of the second rank. Is the only child in a father-child household. Her father prioritizes work and doesn't come home often. She doesn't call people over to her house often, usually only Sendai. Truth be told, she's lonely."
